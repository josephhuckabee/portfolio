         <div class="web"><h3>Anthropos</h3><hr><br><br>Anthropos is a design-focused campaign that Jeffrey [Last Name] and I developed for our Multimedia Project Lab final. Our chosen social cause is homelessness in New York City, and we conducted extensive research to identify the factors that contribute to this issue. Our campaign offers comprehensive resources to guide individuals in need towards finding the assistance they require. Through our efforts, we aim to raise awareness and provide practical support to combat homelessness in NYC.

         <div class=""><h3>Sirius</h3><hr><br><br>Sirius is a website that I designed and developed as part of an advanced Web Development course. The website is designed to provide comprehensive information about our solar system, catering to a broad audience demographic ranging from 14 to 100 years old. Our aim is to provide individuals who are curious about the workings of our universe with accurate and engaging content that informs and educates. Through this website, users can access a wealth of information about the solar system, its celestial objects, and their properties, helping them to expand their knowledge and satisfy their curiosity.
