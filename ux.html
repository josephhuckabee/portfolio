         <div class=""><h3>Sirius</h3><hr><br><br>Sirius is a website that I designed and developed as part of an advanced Web Development course. The website is designed to provide comprehensive information about our solar system, catering to a broad audience demographic ranging from 14 to 100 years old. Our aim is to provide individuals who are curious about the workings of our universe with accurate and engaging content that informs and educates. Through this website, users can access a wealth of information about the solar system, its celestial objects, and their properties, helping them to expand their knowledge and satisfy their curiosity.
