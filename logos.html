          Anthropos is a design-focused campaign created by Jeffrey and myself for our Multimedia Project Lab final. We addressed the issue of homelessness in NYC by researching its causes and compiling resources to help those in need. The visual identity was developed collaboratively and is presented as part of an interactive campaign website.

          Sirius is a website I built for a final project in an advanced Web Development course. It offers educational content about our solar system and is designed for audiences aged 14 and up. The site aims to make space exploration accessible and engaging to curious minds of all backgrounds.
